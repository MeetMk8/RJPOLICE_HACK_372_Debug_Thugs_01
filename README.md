# **Police Feedback System**

Due to antiquated procedures and privacy issues, it is challenging to get input on police activities. Conventional methods, such as complaints calls and inspections, are exclusive and insufficient. This makes it more difficult to comprehend community sentiment and properly handle enforcement concerns.

**Why we Choose this particular Problem Statement?**

- We are the ones that are naturally curious and full of energy to solve problems with ease, and we are capable of solving the idea in a timely manner. We chose the Police Feedback System because, on November 4, 2023, during the New India Vibrant Hackathon 2K23, we had previously worked on the identical issue for the Gujarat Police. We put all of our effort into solving the problem in accordance with the problem description, and we are successful in receiving the judge's opinions and suggestions during the mentoring round.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
